		<blockquote>Gamma Waves are a form of electromagnetic wave, which consist of a extremely short wavelength (less than 1 tenth of a nanometer) which are highly energetic.

		<h3> Electromagnetic Spectrum:</h3>

		<p class="captions"> Image (1): Gamma Waves are depicted as the most energetic type of wave, consisting of extreme short frequency waves.</p> 
		<h2> Properties of Gamma Waves</h2>
		<p> -Gamma Waves is one of the forms of radiation, being preceeded by Alpha and Beta Particle Radiation.
		<br>-Extremely similar to X-rays
		<br>-Electromagnetic Radiation, which means it has no mass.
		<br>-Capable of indirectly ionizing matter
		<br>-Easily pass through objects

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p> -Named by Ernest Rutherford
			<br>-Discovered by Paul Villard in 1905
			<br>-Discovered in Paris, was assisted by the research of Pierre and Marie Curie
			<br>-Was the third type of radioactive component found, being preceded by Alpha and Beta waves.
		<h3 class="h3reduce"> Important Dates</h3>
		<ul class="indent">
			<li>1905– Villard discovers a third component of radioactivity, which become known as gamma rays, 
				following the notation of Rutherford.</li>
			<li>1910– Bragg demonstrates that gamma rays ionize gas just like x-rays. </li>
			<li>1914-Rutherford & Andrade demonstrate the wave nature of gamma rays.	</li>
			<li>1927- Compton defines the quantum of light as being the photon. X-rays and Gamma rays are 
found to be photons. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="h3reduce">Production of Gamma Waves</h2>
		<h3> There are 4 ways to produce Gamma Waves</h3>
		<ol class="indent">
			<li>1. A high-energy particle can collide with another particle</li>

			<li>2. A particle can collide and annihilate with its anti-particle</li>

				<p class="captions1"> Image (4): A particle and its antiparticle collide, releasing gamma waves.</p>
			<li>3. An element can undergo radioactive decay</li>
